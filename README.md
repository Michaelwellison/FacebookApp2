FacebookApp2
============

Second Version of CodePath (Swift) Facebook app

This project took about 20 hours to complete

Required stories completed

* Add a container view and modify properties: backgroundColor, cornerRadius, font, textColor, shadowOffset.
* Add buttons with different images for default and highlighted.
* Add UIImageViews and choose the right mode: aspect fill, aspect fit, etc.
* Add a UITextField with a background image.
* Add UILabels with attributed text (instead of plain text), so that you can bold individual words.
* Setup CocoaPods for managing 3rd party libraries and add TTTAttrubutedString

Optional stories completed

* Optional: Move the textfield when the keyboard appears.
* Optional: The left and right navigation buttons should be real buttons. In other words, when you tap on them, they should have a highlight state. The buttons don't do anything when you tap on them.
* Optional: Tapping on the tabs (requests, messages, etc) should show other view controllers.
* Optional: Implement the notifications page programatically without using Interface Builder. Don't use table views, just statically layout the views assuming no scrolling.

Optional stories not completed
* Optional: The like button should toggle the "liked" state.
* Optional: Tapping on the photo should show a view controller with a full-screen photo.
